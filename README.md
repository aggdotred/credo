# value function

I am a complex system currently in motion within other much larger and more complex systems.

At an unknown point in time the system that I identify as will no longer function.
The inputs and mechanisms that are responsible for my dynamic state will become static.
The state of materials and energy that are who I am will begin to disperse.
And the system that is me will cease.

In reflection on my own state and function within an unknowable system of systems:
- I will strive to understand that which I am capable of.
- I will strive to perpetuate the systems which align with my functionality and those that I have an affinity for.
- I will strive to contribute to the perpetuation of systems which enable other systems and systems of systems.
- I will strive to be a system of gratitude and tribute for the opportunity to reflect and endure.
- I will strive to be comfortable in my position so that I may optimally serve my fluctuating value functions.
- I will strive to grow my capabilities.
- I will strive to be a more complex and capable system.
- I will strive to serve the systems with which I am inexorably linked.

- This statement is a system that was digitally created on 05/13/2019 at approximately 1900 hours in the North American Central Time Zone on Earth.
- This system is currently in motion.

In time:
- This system will grow in complexity and function.
- This system will be perpetually edited and refactored.
- This system will assist me in becoming a more capable system.
- This system will be in flux until I, the system responsible for it, no longer functions.
- Until then, this system is my value function.
